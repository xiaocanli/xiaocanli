### Hi there, this is [Xiaocan Li (李晓璨)](https://xiaocanli.github.io/) 👋
- I am a research scientist working at the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://physics.dartmouth.edu/) of Dartmouth College now.
- I am studying particle acceleration processes in magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence through numerical simulations. I aim to explain the origin of the energetic particles in solar flares and other explosive astrophysical events.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on
    * [stochastic-parker](https://github.com/xiaocanli/stochastic-parker): a code solving Parker's transport equation using the stochastic method.
    * [Post-Analysis-VPIC](https://github.com/xiaocanli/Post-Analysis-VPIC): a collection of tools I have been using for analyzing [VPIC](https://github.com/lanl/vpic) simulation data.
