### Hi there, this is [Xiaocan Li (李晓璨)](https://xiaocanli.github.io/) 👋
- I am a staff scientist working at Los Alamos National Lab.
- I am studying particle acceleration processes in magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence through numerical simulations. I aim to explain the origin of the energetic particles in solar flares and other explosive astrophysical events.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on
    * [stochastic-parker](https://github.com/xiaocanli/stochastic-parker): a code solving particle transport equations using the stochastic method.
